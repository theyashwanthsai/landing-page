# Welcome

Turi Labs is an independent AI playground fueled by curiosity and a relentless drive to build weird, wonderful, and sometimes outright crazy things. We're a small, passionate team of students exploring AI through open-source experiments and rapid prototyping. 


Basically 'mad scientist's garage' 
We thrive on ideation, experimentation, learning from spectacular failures, and diving right back in.


## Areas of Exploration

### Applied AI Shenanigans
- **AI Agents**: Crafting autonomous systems with unpredictable (and hopefully useful) behaviors.
- **Generative Experiments**: Twisting AI to create content you didn't know you needed (or wanted).

### Core AI Tinkering
- **Foundational Models**: Playing with the building blocks of AI, sometimes breaking the rules.
- **Small Language Models**: Seeing how much intelligence we can cram into tiny LLMs.
- **SLM Benchmarks**: Pitting small language models against bizarre and challenging benchmarks.
