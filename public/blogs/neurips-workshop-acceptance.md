I started Turi Labs as an ai agency + research lab. Couple of months after starting, I fell in love with research (being independent gave me a lot of freedom).

Slowly, turilabs shifted to this "semi-real, indie" research lab. Over the last year, I have gained a lot of respect and admiration towards this field of research. Researchers are goated. Being a scientist was everyone's childhood dream, right?

Today, turilabs makes it to NeurIPS (Workshop, LAW 2025). The best ML conf in the world! 
Our first research paper and it is at neurips! How cool is that!

Truly grateful to all the people who came forward to support me with their kind words, help, and contributions. 
I will always value early collaborators working for free to fuel my dreams. 

Thanks to my boss Oluwole Fagbohun for guiding me. He actually told me why the agency model is not needed for someone like me. Turning into pure research was the best choice I made last year (Second to ditching placements)

Many more to come, at much better scale. Build in India for the world.
