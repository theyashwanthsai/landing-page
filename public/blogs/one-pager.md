# Turilabs: One pager for investors
An indie ai research lab focussed on intuition, taste.

### Who we are  
Turilabs is a lean, indie research lab driven by curiosity and experimentation. 

In our first year, we explored 5 self-directed research projects across different areas of AI, one of which was accepted into a NeurIPS workshop.  
2025 was our **exploration** phase: building intuition, taste, and research direction.

Now we’re entering the next phase: 2026 = **exploitation** phase, with a primary focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL).

### The Vision
To build one of the most **efficient and taste-driven AI labs in the world**, where small teams produce outsized research and open-source impact, outside the constraints of academia or corporate labs.

### Why now?
- RL is transitioning from academic novelty → real-world deployment (robotics, agents, autonomy). 
- The current market is dominated by large labs with high burn, slow cycles, and closed research. 
- There is a gap for **fast, independent, high-signal research**, exactly where Turilabs sits.

### Our team & culture
Lean team of 2-3 researchers who love research.
We value:
- deep curiosity over credentials
- first-principles thinking
- high-quality work instead of chasing vague metrics

### Funding ask & use of funds
Raising a micro pre-seed of **$40,000–$50,000** to transition from exploration → execution.

Use of funds will include:
- Compute & infra (GPUs, storage, cloud)
- Researcher stipends & internships  
- Publication, open-source tooling, conference presence

With this funding, in the next 12-18 months, we aim to achieve :
- Good quality research published (RL/agentic systems)
- A working open‑source agent framework or model release
- Strong positioning for follow-on funding or partnerships

### Why invest in Turilabs?
- With modest funding we can run lean, deliver high ROI in research output.
- Indie lab model allows faster pivots and risk‑taking than large institutions.
- Growing network & visibility: Active blogging, open research, and positioning for next wave in RL.

Upside: Research outputs, potential IP/data/model assets, reputation building — early‑stage entry.
