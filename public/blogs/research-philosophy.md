I didn’t start TuriLabs to build products. I started it to explore the world of ML

In a world optimizing for speed, valuation, and virality, we chose understanding. Understanding systems, intelligence, and why some ideas work while others fade away. Basically we are seeking “Tasteful Research”. 

Most research today feels like a race. I wanted to run away from that. Research is conversation with the unknown. It’s the craft of noticing what’s missing, what’s weird, what’s quietly beautiful but ignored.

We believe progress doesn’t come from more compute or larger datasets. It comes from
better questions. It comes from curiosity. The next wave of AI breakthroughs won’t come from trillion-parameter models, but from tasteful exploration. That’s what we’re trying to be.

## Taste
One goal of this lab is to make sure that we develop the ability to choose the right problem. Honing this taste is something which happens with time, provided curious exploration is happening.

We aim to create a structured framework to make sure our efforts are in the right direction. The base of this is derived from this essay. 

Here's a sample glimpse:
1. Read, Read, Read.
2. Discuss with peers and experienced researchers.
3. Reflect periodically.

## Change in Vision
Turilabs was first started as a hub for our side projects and freelance gigs. While the freelance work briefly shaped us into an agency, I soon shelved that idea. As time passed, my mentality changed, and I developed a deep passion for research. Turilabs naturally evolved alongside this, becoming a hub for our research projects. This marked the true start of the lab, and soon, friends joined in to collaborate.

Of course, in the future, we might shift from random exploration to concentrated exploitation to maximize our reward (growing the lab). But we are committed to preserving our core ethos. We hope to always maintain a space for "random exploration," a role that future interns and new researchers can help champion.
