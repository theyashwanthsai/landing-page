Building a SaaS will make you money, not a research lab with random exploration as its core philosophy.

This is the general consensus when it comes to starting something in the AI space. The very idea of an "Indie Research Lab" sounds like a fever dream.

So why do it? Why not just build an AI SaaS?

I've been compiling my thoughts on this.

## Reason 1
Well for starters, I am just afraid of taking risk and placing bets on the "SaaS dream". I would rather take it slow and at my own pace with a research lab. I pay for the credits and computation. 

This way, I don't have to be driven by external factors like revenue targets or user acquisition. Of course, to an outsider, this might look like I'm setting myself up for a downfall. But I do have some ideas to survive while scaling the lab.
## Reason 2
Look at the AI SaaS landscape today. Most of the products we see will eventually pivot to something else or simply fade away. Very few will actually become profitable and have a long, successful run. 

Currently, I don't have the mental energy or that single outlier idea to chase that path.
## Reason 3
AI Research is too general. You could almost call it an "infinite pivot glitch".
The thing is when u pivot too much there is a negative perception from the audience. This is important because audience (users) validate businesses. 
The people are everything and there should not be a bad look. 

This is why smart people often start an agency or an org that allows multiple iterations and experiments. Free from the burden of a single product identity.
## Reason 4
Foundational AI research is yet to catch up in India. Itâ€™s a bold move to be an indie lab here, but that also makes us unique. If our journey can inspire other people in the future, that would be an incredible outcome.
## Reason 5
Foundational research is fun. I can leave my job if I can make enough frm my medium + freelance gigs to keep me well-fed and happy. 

I love working on projects with the simple intent to "try" something new. Experiments are fun to do. There are no hard deadlines, no manager on top of your head pushing you. You do the work based on your own rhythm and curiosity. For someone like me, that autonomy is essential. I do believe with enough time and right consistency, We can produce magic out of thin air. 

### Final thoughts
My friends and I believe that we can produce something novel and impactful. It might be something small, but something that inspires bigger changes in the field. Something that can make people pause.

Something beautiful and undiscovered, just waiting for us to find it.
